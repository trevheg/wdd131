                <h3>Therapy Island</h3>
                <p>The elves of Myrad view crime not as a weakness of character, but as a symptom of mental illness. To that end, their prisons more resemble rehab centers than gaols. My players started their game in group therapy, telling their therapist, Doctor Orym, what crimes they committed to end up in prison.</p>

                <h3>Spider Island</h3>
                <p>This was one of the first places my players visited. As it's name suggests, Spider Island is home to a number of giant spiders. My players were sent there to collect spider silk. On the south side of the island is a grotto with a hidden staircase that leads up to an abandoned watchtower. In this grotto, my players fought a band of Sahuagin (ugly fish people) who were attempting to sacrifice a wyrmling (child dragon) named Othymagathoradrace, or Othym, for short.</p>

            <h3>Nubes Island</h3>
                <p>After rescuing young Othym, my players' characters were invited by Othym's older sister, Akralhamuathin - a dragonborn, to Nubes island to help her with a problem she was having. This island was owned by the mysterious Lord Endermyr, who had hired Elven researchers to resurrect dinosaurs. They had accomplished this through secret magics. Akral asked us to help figure out how the dinosaurs were getting out of their pens, and what was happening to the kobolds who were living on the island. </p>

                <h3>Isle de Rana</h3>
                <p>Isle de Rana works on Myrad much like the island of Tortuga did on Earth: as a haven for pirates. On this island the adventurers find an opportunity to sell their magic items. They weren't able to find any shops that buy their more expensive items, but there is an auction two weeks after they arrive when they will be able to sell them. </p>

                <h3>Koxol Island</h3>
                <p>Looking to get a discount on a magic item, one of my players led the group to Koxol Island, also known as the island of giant insects. The maker of the divices was supposed to be there. On the island, they found that it was indeed covered with giant insects. What was originally thought to be a mountain turned out to be a single anthill.</p>
