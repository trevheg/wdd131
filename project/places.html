        <div class="place">
            <h3>Spider Island</h3>
            <p>This was one of the first places my players visited. As it's name suggests, Spider Island is home to a number of giant spiders. My players were sent there to collect spider silk. On the south side of the island is a grotto with a hidden staircase that leads up to an abandoned watchtower. In this grotto, my players fought a band of Sahuagin (ugly fish people) who were attempting to sacrifice a wyrmling (child dragon) named Othymagathoradrace, or Othym, for short.</p>

            <h3>Nubes Island</h3>
            <p>After rescuing young Othym, my players' characters were invited by Othym's older sister, Akralhamuathin - a dragonborn, to Nubes island to help her with a problem she was having. This island was owned by the mysterious Lord Endermyr, who had hired Elven researchers to resurrect dinosaurs. They had accomplished this through secret magics. Akral asked us to help figure out how the dinosaurs were getting out of their pens, and what was happening to the kobolds who were living on the island. </p>
