                    <h3>What is Myrad?</h3>
                    <p>Myrad is a world I created for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h3>What's Dungeons and Dragons?</h3>
                    <p>Dungeons and Dragons, or D&D, is the first and most popular Table Top Role-Playing Game, or TTRPG. Role-Playing Games are collaborative story-telling experiences. Each player creates a character, and they decide what that character does in the world. One player is called the "Dungeon Master," or DM, (some games prefer the use the term "Game Master," or GM). The DM decides what happens in the world aside from the other players. Together, all the players describe a story of their characters going on grand adventures and becoming great heroes. Or villains, if they choose to.</p>

                    <h3>What kind of a world is Myrad?</h3>
                    <p>Unlike Earth, Myrad has no mega-continents or oceans. The largest islands are not much larger than Great Britain. Cartographers at the Elvish University of Dendra estimate that there are between 10-15 million islands, of which between 100,000 - 200,000 are populated.</p>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h3>What kind of story is being told here?</h3>
                    <p>Given that there are no large land masses, the story told on Myrad is a nautical campaign, featuring a group of would-be pirates. They haven't done much piracy yet (unless you count freeing a group of enslaved natives from their oppressive colonial overlords), but they've only just started!</p>
